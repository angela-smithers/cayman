# [](#header-1) Illustrating a Book for the First Time

This is a personal project that I have set aside for a long time because of the perplexing infinite possibilities of an illustration style.
Should it be realistic or cartoon-y, watercolour or flat colour? How many characters? Should the background be washed-out for a depth-of-field approach?

Imagine my mind's deep paralysis. Who would have thought that infinite choice was my cryptonite?!

## [](#header-2) Characters 2019 vs 2014

So I will explain this new style. 

Can you recognize the elements that make up this character? The character is made of characters. Text. Letters and symbols from a single font family but with different weights.

Not as easy a I had imagined; as least, not as quick as I had imagined.
