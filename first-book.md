# [](#header-1) Illustrating a Book for the First Time

This is a personal project that I have set aside for a long time because of the perplexing infinite possibilities of an illustration style.
Should it be realistic or cartoon-y, watercolour or flat colour? How many characters? Should the background be washed-out for a depth-of-field approach?

Imagine my mind's deep paralysis. Who would have thought that infinite choice was my cryptonite?!
