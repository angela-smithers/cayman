# [](#header-1)School Data Design Challenge

The design challenge details can be found at [DigitalGov.gov](https://digital.gov/2018/09/26/office-educational-technology-hold-design-challenge-supporting-data-reporting-requirements/).

## [](#header-2)My approach
I analyzed a number of non-English inforgraphics for both print and web in order to determine which ones felt friendly and why.

## [](#header-2)My color choices

In order to project a friendly feel, I used secondary and tertiary colors. I tested primary colors, such as blues, and found them to be to stark, rigid and cold.

## [](#header-2)UI Components

Since this was for a government site, I wanted to take advantage of the good, open-source design components provided by [the US Web Design System](https://Standards.USA.gov) because they have already proven to be critical time-savers.

## [](header-2)The Process

...not as easy as one would think given the time constraint and three sets of stakeholders -- and one of which had very louche goals.

### [](header-3)Aftermath
Two days after the challenge was over, my mind was still tingling with ideas. So the final mockups are really cheating the challenge:
